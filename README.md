## CoffeeFilter

Have you or someone on your team ever accidently installed a module without knowing it was *"Generated by CoffeeScript"*? I know the feeling and its horrible! Well have no fear, CoffeeFilter is here to save your day!

Just simply install and as soon as your app attempts to use a module generated by CoffeeScript, your application will segfault for you! YAY!

## Note

I can't believe I have to put this on there, but this is a j-o-k-e. Please don't actually use this in your apps. :-)

## Install

```shell
npm install coffeefilter
```

## Usage

Just require it before everything else:

```javascript

require('coffeefilter');
var obj = require('bastard-who-might-ruin-your-day');
